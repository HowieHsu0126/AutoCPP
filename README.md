# AutoCPP: Automated Continuous-Time Graph Learning for Cascade Popularity Prediction

## Overview

This is the code for our paper **AutoCPP: Automated Continuous-Time Graph Learning for Cascade Popularity Prediction**.
It is a differentiable architecture search framework based on temporal graph neural networks (T-GNNs) for cascade popularity prediction.

## Requirements:

To execute this project, it's essential to install the required dependencies. To do so, navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and execute the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions to run the experiment

To execute the project, run the following command in your terminal:

**Step 1.** Run the search process, given different random seeds.
(The _Twitter_ dataset is used as an example)

```bash
python Libs/Exp/search.py
```

The results are saved in the directory `Output/Logs/`, e.g., `Search-AutoCPP-Twitter`.

**Step 2.** Fine tune the searched architectures. You need specify the arch_filename with the resulting filename from Step 1.

```bash
python Libs/Exp/finetune.py
```

Step 2 is a coarse-graind tuning process, and the results are saved in a picklefile in the directory `Finetune`.
